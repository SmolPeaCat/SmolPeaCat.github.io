## Table of contents

## Why do I want to start writing

I have not always been interesed in writing stuff. When I was in secondary school (before university), I used to read a LOT of books I would practicly always have something in my hands and it would be a book.

Most the time I was only reading mangas, then I moved to YA novels, manhwas and webnovels ( I will probably talk about [Shadow Slave](https://shadowslave.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Slave_Wiki) one day..This novel is nearly perfect..)

Then after some time, I stopped.

I simply couldn't bring myself to read another book, I wanted more, I wanted to write my own book...BUT this idea took a looong time to actually nurture in my head and today I'm happy to announce that I'm writing one.

For my own pleasure thought, I don't plan to share my first book since it is very experimental and frankly my stress level would explode haha

Maybe one day..

_My manager(me) noticed me that there was quite a lot of "I" in the post and that I should change that. Well I don't know what to replace those "I" with..Got any idea ?_

## What am I my using to train myself

Well, I'm using Astro and a template made by [satnaing](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper?tab=readme-ov-file#-documentation) to write this personnal blog/website

I plan on **Trying** to post something new that I learned every day, to practice my english and a bunch of other stuff

For my own book I'm using, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (probably son't have to explain to whoever is reading, you probably already know why it's wonderful _yes I don't have any idea on how to promote something.._)

That is all for the moment.

## My goals

- I want to be able to write any kind of post about the most random thing ever and make it interesting
- // TODO : Find some new ideas for goals
